## 1. INTRODUCTION:

- This file contains the informations about a dataset that is related to credit risk & score. It's a tiny dataset with about 40000 rows and 29 variables that the goal is to work with data analysis/visualization and
machine learning algorithms to predict the target *BAD*.


## 2. PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:

- This code was made on R, which is a language that is not entirely unlike (versions 3 and 4 of) the S language developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Rick Becker, John Chambers and Allan Wilks. R is free software distributed under a GNU-style copyleft. The core of R is an interpreted computer language with a syntax superficially similar to C, but which is actually a "functional programming language" with capabilities similar to Scheme. The language allows branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
